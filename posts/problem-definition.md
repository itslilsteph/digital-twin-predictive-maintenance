# Problem Definition

Industrial electric motors are critical components in modern industrial systems. Unexpected failures can cause downtime, financial loss, and safety risks.

This project explores how vibration and temperature sensing can be used to detect early signs of motor degradation using an embedded, edge-based digital twin approach.
