# digital-twin-predictive-maintenance
This project develops a low-cost, edge-based predictive maintenance system for industrial electric motors using vibration and temperature analysis. An embedded platform processes sensor data locally, updates a digital twin of the motor, and visualises system health and fault indicators through a custom web dashboard.
