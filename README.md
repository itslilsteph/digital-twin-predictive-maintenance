# Digital Twin–Based Predictive Maintenance System

## Overview
This project develops a low-cost, edge-based predictive maintenance system for industrial electric motors using vibration and temperature analysis.

The system uses an embedded platform to perform real-time signal processing and fault detection, supported by a digital twin and a web-based dashboard for visualisation.
